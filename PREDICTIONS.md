## double(n) Prediction

I think the `double` function will return the number multiplied by 2.

For example:
- double(2) should return 4
- double(5) should return 10
- double(0) should return 0

## square(n) Prediction

I think square(n) will return n multiplied by itself.

- square(2) should return 4
- square(5) should return 25
- square(-3) should return 9
