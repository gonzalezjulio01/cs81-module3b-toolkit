# Reflection – CS81 Math Toolkit

## What patterns or surprises did you notice?

I noticed that all the functions had a clear input and output. Once I understood how one function worked, the others started to feel easier. For example, `isEven` and `isOdd` were like opposites, and `double` and `multiply` were very similar. That pattern helped me build confidence.

A surprising thing was how small a function can be and still be useful.

## What logic challenged your thinking?

At first, I didn’t understand how `return` worked inside a function. I also wasn’t sure how to test functions in the console, but once I saw how `console.log()` worked, it made more sense. Thinking in terms of “what input goes in” and “what output comes out” was a big shift in how I think.

## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

This kind of toolkit could be reused in different projects — like a calculator app, a game, or anything that needs math. Having small, tested functions means you can combine them to build more complex things without rewriting everything from scratch.

It also helps you write cleaner, more organized code — and it's easier to test each part separately if something goes wrong.
